        After 40, EVERYTHING Went Downhill, Fast...

        <p>
          Out of no where, my once lean, petite figure became a magnet for pudge
          in all the wrong places
        </p>
        <p>My metabolism seemed to have been turned off overnight</p>
        <p>
          My health began to suffer, and I began to feel drained of energy and
          lifeless throughout the day
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried going to bed earlier, hoping that more sleep would give me
          more energy. I even slept 12 HOURS some nights!
        </p>
        <p>BUT I would still feel drained and lifeless the next day</p>
        <p>At the time I was still ignorant of how BAD my condition was</p>
        <p>
          Until ... my husband and I went to visit his side of the family in San
          Diego for Thanksgiving. He had booked an Airbnb overlooking La Jolla
          Beach for us to stay in
        </p>
        <p>
          Exploring the Airbnb, I saw a fancy digital scale in the bathroom. We
          haven't had a scale in our home in forever
        </p>
        <p>Unthinkingly, I decided to step on..</p>
        <p>219... WHAT? Surely, the scale had to be broken</p>
        <p>That moment hit me like a ton of bricks</p>
        <p>
          I glanced at the bathroom mirror, and was ashamed and disgusted by
          what I saw
        </p>
        <p>
          I had huge bags under my eyes. I was so pudgy and ... dare I say...
          "round"?
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked terrible. I was so angry at myself. When did I stop taking
          care of myself? How did I let it get this bad?
        </p>
        <p>The number on the scale haunted me the rest of the day</p>
        <p>
          I knew I had to make a change. What I had become was unacceptable, and
          that night as I was preparing for bed, I made a decision
        </p>

              <p>The first thing I did when I got home was start walking.</p>
              <p>
                But I quickly discovered that my knees weren't able to support
                the extra weight I was carrying.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then I tried a full body cleanse with green smoothies and
                juicing.
              </p>
              <p>
                I made some progress, but then I got too hungry and ended up
                snacking, which completely ruined my momentum.
              </p>
              <p>
                I even attempted some bizarre home remedies that I found on the
                internet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Things like weird mixtures of apple cider vinegar, liquid braggs
                aminos, and yeast flakes all blended together. Yuck!

              <p>I even tried sleeping with an onion in my sock!</p>

                Next, I tried Keto. I lasted for two whole weeks, but I missed
                my breads and pastas too much.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then I tried counting macros, and even went Raw Vegan for a
                while.
              </p>
              <p>BUT, my scale numbers barely moved at all.</p>
              <p>I was going through all this torture for minimal results.</p>
              <p>
                I was angry and discouraged. I thought..."I'm trying so hard.
                What am I doing wrong?"
              </p>
              <p>
                Up to now, I had wanted to keep my weight loss journey private
                and hadn't told any family or friends.
              </p>
              <p>
                But I was so desperate that I called my friend Elizabeth, who
                studied naturopathic medicine when we were in college 40 years
                ago.

                She explained that my weight gain had NOTHING to do with how

              </p>
              <p>
                She said, "Susan, I've known Jared and you for a long time, and

            Before I knew it, an hour had passed, and I was BLOWN AWAY by

                  I could have easily disregarded Elizabeth when she told me about this unusual Rice Method, but I put my skepticism away.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Now, I am so proud of my progress, and I feel like I'm finally the "REAL ME" again.
              </p>
              <p>
                  All because I took the time to learn and implement this metabolism-boosting loophole. Who would have thought?
              </p>
              <p>
                  Of course, I have started getting questions from friends about how I've been able to make this progress so quickly, and I want to help others the same way Elizabeth helped me.
              </p>
              <p>
                  So, I have put the link to the same website Elizabeth shared with me below.
              </p>
              <p>
                  That is ... if it's STILL up.
              </p>
              <p>
                  If the link doesn't work, it is due to pending legal actions from pharmaceutical companies trying to keep this hidden from the public.
              </p>
              <p>
                  I guess the wisest thing to do would be to click right now to make sure you get to learn about this metabolism loophole for yourself before it's taken down. ⬇⬇
